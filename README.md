### Detecting Human-Object Interaction via Fabricated Compositional Learning (CVPR2021)


This repository is built from the code of previous approaches. Thanks for their excellent work.


In this repository, we have removed massive comments. Current code only contains zero-shot HOI detection and I have not tested this code. Full code is being constructed. We will include VCL, FCL and our new work in a single project.

Here ([FCL_VCOCO](https://github.com/zhihou7/FCL_VCOCO)) is the Code for V-COCO 

Thanks for all reviewer's comments. Our new work, an extension of VCL, will be coming soon.

## Prerequisites

This codebase was developed and tested with Python3.7, Tensorflow 1.14.0, Matlab (for evaluation), CUDA 10.0 and Centos 7


## Installation

1. Download HICO-DET dataset. Setup V-COCO and COCO API. Setup HICO-DET evaluation code.
    ```Shell
    chmod +x ./misc/download_dataset.sh 
    ./misc/download_dataset.sh 
    ```

2. Install packages by pip.

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
   
## Training
1. Download COCO pre-trained weights and training data
    ```Shell
    chmod +x ./misc/download_training_data.sh 
    ./misc/download_training_data.sh
    ```

3. Train Zero-Shot HOI model on HICO-DET
    ```Shell
    python tools/Train_FCL_HICO.py
    ```
    
### Test

we provide this scripts to test code and eval the results.

    ```Shell
    python scripts/eval.py
    ```
    
### Data & Model
#### Data
We present the differences between different detector in our paper and analyze the effect of object boxes on HOI detection. VCL detector and DRG detector can be download from the corresponding paper. 
Here, we provide the GT boxes.

This work was finished about 10 months ago. In the first submission, we compare the difference among COCO detector, Fine-tuned Detector and GT boxes. We further find DRG object detector largely increases the baseline. 
All these comparisons illustrate the significant effect of object detector on HOI. That's really necessary to provide the performance of object detector.

#### Pretrained Model
